and again he sent forth the dove out of the ark ; 8 : 11 and the dove came in to him in the evening ; and, lo, in her mouth was an olive leaf pluckt off : so noah knew that the waters were abated from off the earth. 8 : 12 and he stayed yet other seven days ; and sent forth the dove ; which returned not again unto him any more. 8 : 13 and it came to pass in the six hundredth and first year, in the first month, the first day of the month, the waters were dried up from off the earth : and noah removed the covering of the ark, and looked, and, behold, the face of the ground was dry.',\n","  '7 : 17 and the flood was forty days upon the earth ;

and all the high hills, that were under the whole heaven, were covered. 7 : 20 fifteen cubits upward did the waters prevail ; and the mountains were covered. 7 : 21 and all flesh died that moved upon the earth, both of fowl, and of cattle, and of beast, and of every creeping thing that creepeth upon the earth, and every man : 7 : 22 all in whose nostrils was the breath of life, of all that was in the dry land, died. 7 : 23 and every living substance was destroyed which was upon the face of the ground, both man, and cattle, and the creeping things, and the fowl of the heaven ;

both man, and beast, and the creeping thing, and the fowls of the air ; for it repenteth me that i have made them. 6 : 8 but noah found grace in the eyes of the lord. 6 : 9 these are the generations of noah : noah was a just man and perfect in his generations, and noah walked with god. 6 : 10 and noah begat three sons, shem, ham, and japheth. 6 : 11 the earth also was corrupt before god, and the earth was filled with violence.',\n","  '5 : 28 and lamech lived an hundred eighty and two years, and begat a son : 5 : 29 and he called his name noah, saying, this same shall comfort us concerning our work and toil of our hands, because of the ground which the lord hath cursed. 5 : 30 and lamech lived after he begat noah five hundred ninety and five years, and begat sons and daughters : 5 : 31 and all the days of lamech were seven hundred seventy and seven years : and he died. 5 : 32 and noah was five hundred years old : and noah begat shem, ham, and japheth. 6 : 1 and it came to pass, when men began to multiply on the face of the earth, and daughters were born unto them, 6 : 2 that the sons of god saw the daughters of men that they were fair ; and they took them wives of all which they chose. 6 : 3 and the lord said, my spirit shall not always strive with man, for that he also is flesh : yet his days shall be an hundred and twenty years.',\n","  '6 : 18 but with thee will i establish my covenant ; and thou shalt come into the ark, thou, and thy sons, and thy wife, and thy sons ’ wives with thee. 6 : 19 and of every living thing of all flesh, two of every sort shalt thou bring into the ark, to keep them alive with thee ; they shall be male and female. 6 : 20 of fowls after their kind, and of cattle after their kind, of every creeping thing of the earth after his kind, two of every sort shall come unto thee, to keep them alive. 6 : 21 and take thou unto thee of all food that is eaten, and thou shalt gather it to thee ; and it shall be for food for thee, and for them. 6 : 22 thus did noah ; according to all that god commanded him, so did he. 7 : 1 and the lord said unto noah, come thou and all thy house into the ark ; for thee have i seen righteous before me in this generation. 7 : 2 of every clean beast thou shalt take to thee by sevens, the male and his female : and of beasts that are not clean by two, the male and his female.']]"]},"metadata":{},"execution_count":43}]},{"cell_type":"code","source":[],"metadata":{"id":"lknbyo86ACM6"},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}]}
